## Schreiner (12/15P)

### 1 Exploring Hyperparameters (3.5/5P)

 * hyperparameter values make sense
   * yes (1P)
 * networks were trained correctly
   * yes (1P)
 * there are results
   * yes (1P)
 * report and visualization
   * inference time missing - inference time is the time needed for a prediction (-0.5P)
   * lots of duplicate code (-0.5P)
   * a plot or table with aggregated results would have been nice (-0.5P)
   * rest looks fine (0.5P)

### 2 Dataset (5/5P)

 * sufficient images captured
   * yes (1P)
 * sufficient images annotated
   * yes (2P)
 * annotations compatible with HaGRID dataset
   * yes (1P)
 * confusion matrix
   * yes (1P)

### 3 Media Controls (3.5/5P)

 * three hand poses are tracked and distinguished reliably
   * for me, it said "stop" or "no-gesture" like all the time (-1P)
   * but it should work with a better model (1P)
 * three media control features implemented
   * yes (1P)
 * mapping works and makes sense
   * yes (1P)
 * low latency
   * sleeping for 300 ms is not ideal for low latency (-0.5P)
