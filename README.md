# Assignment 5

Import HAGRID dataset as folder "data" in parent folder of whole assignment (assignment-05-cnn-sina-sch)(Reason: folder was too large to push to git)

## Exercise 1:
View notebook.

## Exercise 2: 
Images have a resolution of 1280 x 720px and are stored in the folder 'data-schreiner'. Model can be trained by running train_model.py.

## Exercise 3:
Model can be trained by running train_model.py. Run media_control.py to increase volume by the "like"-gesture, decrease by "disliking", and stopping a track by the "stop"-gesture (I tried it with a white wall as background).
